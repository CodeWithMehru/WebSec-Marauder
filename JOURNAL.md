> **Image disclaimer:** The product/board images in this repo are for documentation and demo purposes only. The ESP32/Marauder images were downloaded as reference/demo images from the web to represent the prototype â€” they do not imply the physical hardware is currently in-hand. I will update the repository with original photos and receipts when the components are available.
